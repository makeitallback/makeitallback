## 🌍 What is MIAB?

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is a community-driven token and builder movement.  
It turns the “we’ll make it back” meme into a flywheel of **real products** and **acquired dApps** that all **use MIAB for access and fees**.

- We **launch** via a bonding curve.
- We **debase** supply continuously on-chain (~4.32%/day).
- We offer **vaults** for protection, staking/rebirth, and LP participation.
- We **build & acquire** tools that accept MIAB, and recycle revenue into **buybacks** and **new teams**.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

- **Bonding Curve (Genesis):** Early participants mint through an x·y=k pool until target depth; then liquidity is paired and trading opens.
- **Debase Engine:** Supply shrinks by ~0.00002%/block (≈4.32% daily). Decay applies proportionally to wallets, LP, and vault balances.
- **Vaults:**
  - **Sanctum (Protected):** Deposit → withdraw same amount after 24h; immune to decay.
  - **Rebirth (Staking):** Accept decay; earn a portion of daily “reborn” emissions.
  - **Builder/LP Vault:** Stake LP; earn from the rebirth pool while supporting market depth.
- **Sell-Gate Governance (Genesis):** Holders who buy via the curve vote to enable/disable sell. Selling burns your voting power.

> **Formula:** `multiplier = multiplier * (1 - rate) ^ blocksElapsed`

## 🧰 MIAB Tool Ecosystem

Every product accepts **MIAB** for access. Revenue flows to **buybacks** and the **Builder Treasury** to fund more tools and acquisitions.

### 🪙 MIABPAD — DAO Launchpad (Phase 1)
Community-governed launches (fair or bonding-curve), automated LP pairing, and on-chain approvals using MIAB.
- **Fees:** Paid in MIAB → **buybacks** + treasury funding.

### 📊 MIAB PORTFOLIO — Degen Tracker (Phase 2)
Multichain wallet + PnL with degen-focused insights (rugs survived, gas burned, comeback trades).
- **Pro features:** Unlockable with MIAB.

### ⚡ BUYBOT — Multichain Trade Assistant
Scans fresh deploys and trends; lets users set rules/alerts and execute across chains.
- **Subs/credits:** Settled in MIAB.

### 🔍 On-Chain Researcher — Market Intelligence Hub
Tracks deployers, whales, and upcoming launches; feeds discovery into MIABPAD.
- **Access:** MIAB-gated tiers.

> **Expansion Plan:** Keep **building new tools** and **acquiring useful dApps** to integrate MIAB as the default fee & access token across the stack.
