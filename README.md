## 🌍 **What is MIAB?**

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is a self-decaying, community-powered token that funds real products and on-chain tools.  
It’s an ecosystem of believers who turn every rug, every loss, every failed launch into fuel for the next build.

💡 **In short:**  
We don’t chase pumps — we build tools that help degens *make it all back*.

---

## ⚙️ **Core Mechanics**

> “Everything burns — even belief. But creation survives.”

### 🔸 Bonding Curve Launch
- Early believers mint MIAB through a bonding curve (x × y = k).  
- When the pool fills, liquidity auto-pairs → MIAB goes live on Monad.

### 🔸 Debase Engine
- Supply decays by **0.00002 % per block (~4.32 % daily)**.  
- Decay hits all wallets, LPs, and vaults equally.  
- Tokens vanish block by block — a living proof of time and belief.

### 🔸 Vault System
| Vault | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| 🛡 **Sanctum Vault** | Protected. Deposit → withdraw same amount after 24 h. Immune to decay. |
| 🔁 **Rebirth Vault** | Accept decay to earn from reborn supply (~10 % daily remint). |
| 💧 **Builder Vault** | Stake LP, support liquidity, earn from 30 % of rebirth pool. |

### 🔸 Governance Sell Gate
- During Genesis, selling can be toggled **on/off** by holders.  
- 1 vote per 1 M MIAB bought.  
- Selling resets your vote. No weak hands in governance.

## 🧠 **Why MIAB Exists**

Because the degen world needed something more than memes — it needed a **movement**.  
MIAB’s purpose is to create a **self-sustaining builder economy** powered by decay, belief, and revenue-driven rebirth.

Each block that burns helps fund:
- New tools 🧰  
- New teams 👩‍💻  
- New integrations 🤝  
- Token buybacks 💸  

---

## 🧰 **The MIAB Tool Ecosystem**

Every product and dApp uses **MIAB** as the native currency for access, fees, and governance.  
Revenue is recycled into buybacks and the Builder Treasury to keep the flywheel spinning.

---

### 🪙 **1. MIABPAD — DAO Launchpad (Phase 1)**  
- Community-governed launch platform for bonding-curve & fair launches.  
- Projects proposed → voted → deployed by holders.  
- **Revenue:** Launch fees buy back MIAB and fund the Builder Treasury.  
> “Belief turned into buyback.”

---

### 📊 **2. MIAB Portfolio — Degen Tracker (Phase 2)**  
- Multichain dashboard that tracks your wins, losses, rugs, and recoveries.  
- Displays gas burned, total cope, and make-it-back moments.  
- **Revenue:** Premium analytics payable in MIAB.  
> “Your on-chain chaos, beautifully organized.”

---

### ⚡ **3. BuyBot — Trade Assistant**  
- Cross-chain bot for new token snipes, alerts, and automated entries.  
- **Subs:** MIAB-based tiers that feed treasury.  
> “Let your trades work while you sleep.”

---

### 🔍 **4. On-Chain Researcher — Market Intelligence**  
- Detects upcoming launches, trending deployers, and top wallets.  
- Integrates with MIABPAD for early alpha validation.  
> “It finds opportunity before it trends.”

---

### 🌐 **5. Continuous Expansion**
We keep building.  
We keep acquiring promising dApps to bring them under the MIAB umbrella.  
Each integration deepens token utility — from trading tools to analytics, vaults, and governance layers.

## 🔁 **The MIAB Flywheel**

</p>

**MIAB → Tools & Products → Revenue → Buybacks + Treasury → New Teams & Builds → More MIAB Utility**

Every decay funds a rebuild. Every rebuild expands utility.
