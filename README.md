## 🌍 **Overview**

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental memecoin that fuses **degen culture, innovation, and decay mechanics** into a single living system.

Built on **BNB Chain**, MIAB is more than a token — it’s a **community-funded builder engine**.

Each block decays its supply, but that decay fuels the next cycle of creation — funding new tools, hiring contributors, and expanding the ecosystem.

---

## 🧠 **The Cause**

Everyone in crypto has said it once:  
> “Don’t worry, I’ll make it all back.”

MIAB turns that meme into a mission.  
It’s an **on-chain builder experiment** powered by **belief, burn, and rebirth**.

Every purchase through the bonding curve contributes to the **Builder Treasury**,  
used to develop products for the degen world — from **buy bots**, to **alpha scanners**, to **launchpads**, and more.

---

## 🚀 **Launch Phases**

### **Phase 1 — The Spark**
MIAB appears. The experiment is revealed to the BNB community — a call for believers who understand that real degens don’t just ape; they build.

### **Phase 2 — The Genesis Curve**
A **bonding curve** opens, allowing believers to mint MIAB by sacrificing base assets.  
Powered by **Uniswap v2 (x × y = k)** mechanics, liquidity auto-pairs upon fill — marking the **birth of MIAB** and the beginning of the decay cycle.

### **Phase 3 — The Debase Engine Activates**
Once liquidity is formed, the **Debase Engine** awakens —  
reducing supply by ~4% daily, block by block, turning **time into burn** and **burn into belief**.

---

## 🧩 **Bonding Curve Governance**

Unlike typical bonding curves, MIAB’s curve is **governed by its believers**.  
Selling is not a given — it’s earned through **on-chain voting.**

### 🗳️ **Voting Logic**
- **Eligibility:** Only wallets that have purchased MIAB can vote.  
- **Power:** 1 vote per 1,000,000 MIAB bought.  
- **Options:** Enable or disable selling.  
- **Vote Reset:** Selling burns your vote.

> “If you dump, you lose your voice.”

---

## ⚙️ **The Debase Engine**

The **Debase Engine** is MIAB’s mathematical heart —  
a self-destructive yet regenerative loop that decays supply at every block.

- **Avg. Block Time:** 0.4s  
- **Debase Rate:** 0.00002% per block (~4.32% daily)  
- **Mechanic:** Every wallet, LP, and vault decays equally — no exceptions.

**📉 Daily Simulation:**

| **Day** | **Starting Supply** | **Tokens Vanished** |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 100,000,000,000 | 4,320,000,000 |
| 2 | 95,680,000,000  | 4,146,624,000 |
| 3 | 91,533,376,000  | 3,978,019,000 |
| 4 | 87,555,357,000  | 3,814,576,000 |
| 5 | 83,740,781,000  | 3,656,153,000 |

After five days, **~20B MIAB** vanish — a proof of on-chain decay.

## 🏦 **Vault Mechanics**

Three vaults define MIAB’s philosophy:  
**Protection, Rebirth, and Creation.**

### 🔒 **1. Sanctum Vault — Protected**
- Deposit MIAB, withdraw after 24h.  
- Immune to decay.  
- Safe, simple, unrewarded.  
> “For those who choose faith over yield.”

### 🔁 **2. Rebirth Vault — Stake Through Decay**
- Stake MIAB directly into decay.  
- Earn **10% of daily burned supply** as reborn MIAB.  
- **9%** freshly minted for dev funding & ecosystem growth.  
> “Sacrifice to rebuild.”

### 💧 **3. Builder Vault — LP + Ecosystem**
- LP stakers earn from a **30% daily rebirth pool.**  
- Revenue supports the **Builder Treasury** — funding future tools.  
> “You fuel the tools that make it all back.”

## 🧰 **MIAB Tool Ecosystem**

Every block, vault, and trade powers a **builder economy** —  
a growing network of tools that give MIAB real utility.  

💚 **Core Mission:** Keep building. Keep acquiring. Keep integrating.  

All revenue under the MIAB banner cycles back via **buybacks**, **vault rewards**, or **new dev team funding**.

---

### 🪙 **MIABPAD — DAO Launchpad (Phase 1)**
The first product — a **community-governed launchpad** for fair curve launches, liquidity pairing, and governance-driven listings.  
💸 **Revenue:** Launch fees are used to **buy back MIAB** and fund new tools.  
> “Belief becomes buyback.”

---

### 📊 **MIAB PORTFOLIO — Degen Tracker (Phase 2)**
A multichain dashboard tracking wins, losses, and rugs — with flair.  
💸 **Revenue:** Premium dashboards paid in MIAB support **buybacks** and builder rewards.  
> “Your chaos, beautifully organized.”

---

### ⚡ **BUYBOT — Multichain Trade Assistant**

💸 **Revenue:** Access fees fund treasury expansion.  
> “Find opportunity before it’s viral.”

---

### 🌐 **Continuous Expansion**
MIAB evolves through new dApps, partnerships, and acquisitions:  
- 🧱 Acquire & integrate degen tools  
- ⚙️ Develop new utilities  
- 🔗 Expand MIAB acceptance across Web3  
> “We build. We acquire. We make it all back — together.”

---

## 🔁 **The MIAB Flywheel**

1️⃣ Believers buy through the bonding curve  
2️⃣ Fees & decay fund the **Builder Treasury**  
3️⃣ Treasury builds new tools  
4️⃣ Tools charge MIAB  
5️⃣ Utility drives demand  
> “Every fade funds the next build.”

## 💠 **Tokenomics**

| **Property** | **Value** |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Name** | Make It All Back |
| **Ticker** | MIAB |
| **Type** | ERC20 (Monad) |
| **Supply** | 100,000,000,000 |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Debase Rate** | 0.00002% / block (~4.32% daily) |
| **Vaults** | Sanctum, Rebirth, Builder |

---

## 🧱 **Game Theory**

MIAB isn’t just a token — it’s a **belief engine.**  
Each decay fuels creation; each burn powers builders.  

> “Supply dies, but creation lives.”

Equilibrium emerges naturally: supply falls, LP adjusts, value sustains.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Builder Treasury**

Collected from:
- 🪙 Bonding Curve Fees  
- 🔁 Vault Mints  
- ⚡ Product Payments  

Funds are used to hire teams and ship tools.  
> “If you can build, you’re welcome here.”

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

MIAB is an **experimental, community-driven project** exploring belief, decay, and on-chain creation.  
It is not financial advice or an investment. Participate responsibly.
