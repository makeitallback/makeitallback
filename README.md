## 🌍 **Overview**

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental memecoin that blends **degen culture, AI innovation, and deflationary mechanics** into one living system.

Built on **BNB chain**, MIAB is more than a token — it’s a **community-funded builder engine.**

Each block decays its supply, but that decay fuels the next cycle of creation:

funding new degen tools, hiring, and expanding the ecosystem.

---

## 🧠 **The Cause**

Everyone in crypto has said it once:

> “Don’t worry, I’ll make it all back.”

MIAB turns that meme into a mission.

It’s an **on-chain builder experiment** powered by belief, burn, and rebirth.

Every purchase through the bonding curve contributes to the **Builder Treasury**,  
used to develop products for the degen world — from **buy bots**, to **alpha scanners**, to **launchpads**, and more.

---

## 🚀 **Launch Phases**

### **Phase 1 — The Spark**
MIAB appears. The experiment is revealed to the BNB community — a call for believers who understand that real degens don’t just ape; they build.

### **Phase 2 — The Genesis Curve**
A **bonding curve** opens, allowing early believers to mint MIAB by sacrificing base assets.  
The curve uses the **Uniswap V2 formula (x × y = k)**, creating a self-contained market before open trading.  
Once the Genesis pool fills, liquidity is automatically paired and launched — marking the **birth of MIAB** and the beginning of the decay cycle.

### **Phase 3 — The Debase Engine Activates**
After liquidity forms, the **Debase Engine** awakens.  
From that block onward, the total MIAB supply begins to **decay by ~4% daily**, block by block.  
Supply vanishes — belief gets tested — but the ecosystem continues to evolve.

---

## 🧩 **Bonding Curve Governance**

Unlike typical bonding curves, MIAB’s curve is **governed by the community.**  
Selling during the Genesis phase is controlled through **on-chain voting.**

### 🗳️ **Voting Logic**
- **Eligibility:** Only wallets that have purchased MIAB on the bonding curve can vote.  
- **Power:** 1 vote per 1,000,000 MIAB bought.  
- **Options:** Enable or Disable Selling.  
- **Vote Reset:** Selling any MIAB burns your vote.  

> “If you dump, you lose your voice.”

---

## ⚙️ **The Debase Engine**

The **Debase Engine** is the mathematical heart of MIAB —  
a continuous entropy loop that shrinks supply at the block level.

- **Average block time:** 0.4s  
- **Debase rate:** 0.00002% per block (~4.32% per day)

All balances decay proportionally — wallets, LPs, vaults, and treasury alike.  
No exceptions. Everyone fades together.

**📉 4.32% Daily Debase Simulation**

| **Day** | **Starting Supply** | **Tokens Vanished** |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 100,000,000,000 | 4,320,000,000 |
| 2 | 95,680,000,000  | 4,146,624,000 |
| 3 | 91,533,376,000  | 3,978,019,000 |
| 4 | 87,555,357,000  | 3,814,576,000 |
| 5 | 83,740,781,000  | 3,656,153,000 |

After five days, nearly **20B MIAB** vanish — the proof of on-chain decay.

## 🏦 **Vault Mechanics**

The **Vaults** represent three philosophies of faith and participation:  
**Protection, Rebirth, and Creation.**

### 🔒 **1. Sanctum Vault — The Protected Vault**
- Deposit MIAB, withdraw the same after a 24h lock.  
- Tokens here are **immune to decay.**  
- No rewards, no risk — only preservation.  
> “For those who want safety, not growth.”

### 🔁 **2. Rebirth Vault — Staking Through Decay**
- Stake MIAB directly into the Decay Engine.  
- Tokens decay, but you earn **10% of the daily burned supply** as reborn MIAB.  
- An additional **9%** is newly minted linearly for dev funding and tool development.  
> “Sacrifice to rebuild.”

### 💧 **3. Builder Vault — LP + Ecosystem Vault**
- LP stakers contribute to market stability.  
- They earn from a **30% daily rebirth pool**, derived from decayed supply.  
- Revenue also funds the **Builder Treasury**, supporting new tool teams.  
> “You fuel the tools that make it all back.”

## 🧰 **MIAB Tool Ecosystem**

Every block, vault, and transaction in MIAB fuels a **builder economy**,  
an expanding network of products and dApps that give the token real, growing utility.

The core mission is simple:  
**keep building, keep acquiring, keep integrating**  
until MIAB becomes the fuel token used across every tool the community touches.

All product revenue flows back through **buybacks**, **vault rewards**, or **builder funding.**

---

### 🪙 **1. MIABPAD — DAO Launchpad (Phase 1)**
A **community-governed launchpad** where projects are reviewed, voted, and launched by holders.  
💸 **Revenue Flow:** Platform fees are used to **buy back MIAB** and strengthen liquidity.  
> “The first platform that turns belief into buyback.”

---

### 📊 **2. MIAB PORTFOLIO — Degen Tracker (Phase 2)**
A multichain dashboard tracking profits, losses, and rugged trades.  
💸 **Revenue Flow:** Premium access payable in MIAB → supports buybacks and future builders.  
> “Your on-chain chaos, beautifully organized.”

---

### ⚡ **3. BUYBOT — Multichain Trade Assistant**
An automated tool that scans launches and executes smart buys.  
💸 **Revenue Flow:** All fees cycle into the Builder Treasury, reinforcing the **make-it-back loop.**  
> “Let your trades work while you sleep.”

---

### 🔍 **4. On-Chain Researcher — Market Intelligence Hub**
Tracks new deploys, whales, and alpha signals.  
💸 **Revenue Flow:** Subscription fees return to the treasury and fund ecosystem growth.  
> “It finds opportunity before it goes viral.”

---

### 🌐 **Continuous Expansion**
The MIAB ecosystem never ends —  
it grows through **new tools, partnerships, and acquisitions.**

- **Acquire & integrate** existing dApps  
- **Develop** new utilities  
- **Partner** with external platforms accepting MIAB  
> “We build. We acquire. We make it all back — together.”

---

## 🔁 **The MIAB Flywheel**

1️⃣ Buyers join through the bonding curve  
2️⃣ Fees & decay feed the **Builder Treasury**  
3️⃣ Treasury funds product development  
4️⃣ Tools charge MIAB for access  
5️⃣ Demand loops back — strengthening utility  

> “Every fade funds the next build.”

## 💠 **Tokenomics**

| **Property** | **Value** |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Name** | Make It All Back |
| **Ticker** | MIAB |
| **Type** | ERC20 (Monad) |
| **Supply** | 100,000,000,000 |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Debase Rate** | 0.00002% per block (~4.32% daily) |
| **Vaults** | Sanctum, Rebirth, Builder |

---

## 🧱 **Game Theory**

MIAB isn’t just a market — it’s a **belief engine.**  
Every holder decays, but the ecosystem grows.  
Every token lost fuels another line of code, another tool, another chance to make it back.  

> “Supply dies, but creation lives.”

This cycle keeps value balanced as supply shrinks —  
while real utility keeps pushing demand upward.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Builder Treasury**

All MIAB collected from:
- Curve fees  
- Vault rebirth mint  
- Tool payments  

flows into the **Builder Treasury**, which funds new teams, devs, and tools.

> “If you can build, you’re welcome here.”

---

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental, community-driven protocol exploring belief, decay, and on-chain creation.  
It is not a financial product or investment.  
Participation is voluntary and carries risk.  
Revenue funds ecosystem growth and tool development.
