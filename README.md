## 🌍 **What is MIAB?**

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental builder token built on **BNB Chain** —  
a self-decaying system where every block funds future innovation.  

It merges **degen culture**, **deflationary mechanics**, and **on-chain governance** to create a sustainable builder ecosystem.  
Each cycle of decay funds new dApps, products, and integrations that *use MIAB as their native token.*

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

**MIAB** operates as a living economy of decay and rebirth:

- **Bonding Curve Launch:** Fair start for all early believers.  
- **Debase Engine:** Supply decays ~4.32% daily, ensuring scarcity.  
- **Vaults:** Protect, stake, or build — your choice.  
- **Builder Treasury:** All fees and rebirth supply fund future tool development.  

> *Every token lost fuels another creation.*

---

## 🧠 **Why It Exists**

The crypto space runs on one mantra:  
> “I’ll make it all back.”

MIAB is that mantra — made on-chain.  
It takes the chaos, burn, and cope of degen culture and channels it into **creation and utility**.  

Every fee, burn, and vault cycle supports new builder teams, products, and ecosystem growth.  

---

## 🧰 **Ecosystem & Tools**

MIAB fuels a growing network of products and acquisitions — all tied to its token utility.
