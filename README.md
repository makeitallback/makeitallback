## 🌍 Overview

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental memecoin that blends **degen culture, AI innovation, and deflationary mechanics** into one living system.

Built on BNB chain, MIAB is more than a token—it's a **community-funded builder engine**.

Each block decays its supply, but that decay fuels the next cycle of creation: funding new AI-powered degen tools, hiring, and expanding the ecosystem.

---

## 🧠 The Cause

Everyone in crypto has said it once:

> **"Don't worry, I'll make it all back."**

MIAB turns that meme into a mission.

It's an **on-chain builder experiment** powered by belief, burn, and rebirth.

Every purchase through the bonding curve contributes to the **Builder Treasury**, used to develop AI products for the degen world—from **buy bots**, to **alpha scanners**, to **launchpads** and more.

---

## 🚀 Launch Phases

### Phase 1 — The Spark

MIAB appears. The experiment is revealed to the BNB community — a call for believers who understand that real degens don't just ape; they build.

---

### Phase 2 — The Curve

A **bonding curve** opens, allowing early believers to mint MIAB by sacrificing base assets.

The curve uses the **Uniswap V2 formula (x × y = k)**, creating a self-contained market before open trading. Once the Genesis pool fills, liquidity is automatically paired and launched.

That marks the **birth of MIAB** — and the beginning of the decay cycle.

---

### Phase 3 — The Debase Engine Activates

After liquidity forms, the **Debase Engine** awakens.

From that block onward, the total MIAB supply begins to **decay by ~4% daily**, block by block.

Supply vanishes — belief gets tested — but the ecosystem continues to evolve.

---

## 🧩 Bonding Curve Governance

Unlike typical bonding curves, MIAB's curve is **governed by the community**.

Selling during the Genesis phase is controlled through **on-chain voting**.

### 🗳️ Voting Logic

- **Eligibility:** Only wallets that have purchased MIAB on the bonding curve can vote.
- **Power:** 1 vote per 1,000,000 MIAB bought.
- **Options:** Enable or Disable Selling.
- **Vote Reset:** Selling any MIAB burns your vote.

This system ensures that only true believers influence the curve's lifecycle.

> **"If you dump, you lose your voice."**

---

## ⚙️ The Debase Engine

The **Debase Engine** is the mathematical heart of MIAB — a continuous entropy loop that shrinks supply at the block level.

- **Average block time:** 0.4s
- **Debase rate:** 0.00002% per block (~4.32% per day)

```javascript
multiplier = multiplier * (1 - rate) ^ blocksElapsed
```

All balances decay proportionally — wallets, LPs, vaults, and treasury alike.

**No exceptions. Everyone fades together.**

### 📉 4.32% Daily Debase Simulation

| **Day** | **Starting Supply** | **Tokens Vanished** |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | 1,000,000,000 | 43,200,000 |
| 2 | 956,800,000 | 41,333,760 |
| 3 | 915,466,240 | 39,548,141 |
| 4 | 875,918,099 | 37,839,662 |
| 5 | 838,078,437 | 36,204,989 |

After five days, nearly **200M MIAB** vanish — the proof of on-chain decay.

---

## 🏦 Vault Mechanics

The **Vaults** represent three philosophies of faith and participation:

Protection, Rebirth, and Creation.

---

### 🔒 1. Protector Vault - The Protected Vault

- Deposit MIAB, withdraw the same after a 24h lock.
- Tokens here are **immune to decay**.
- No rewards, no risk — only preservation.

> **"For those who want safety, not growth."**

---

### 🔁 2. Rebirth Vault - Staking Through Decay

- Stake MIAB directly into the Decay Engine.
- Tokens decay, but you earn **10% of the daily burned supply** as reborn MIAB.
- An additional **9%** is newly minted linearly — for dev funding and tool development.

> **"Sacrifice to rebuild."**

---

### 💧 3. Builder Vault — LP + Ecosystem Vault

- LP stakers contribute to market stability.
- They earn from a **30% daily rebirth pool**, derived from decayed supply.
- Revenue also funds the **Builder Treasury**, which supports new AI tool teams.

> **"You fuel the tools that make it all back."**

---

## 🧰 MIAB Tool Ecosystem

Every block, vault, and transaction in MIAB fuels a **builder economy**, an expanding network of products and dApps that give the token real, growing utility.

The core mission is simple:

**keep building, keep acquiring, keep integrating**

until MIAB becomes the fuel token used across every tool the community touches.

All revenue generated from products under the MIAB banner flows back into the system either through **buybacks**, **vault rewards**, or **funding new development teams**.

---

### 🪙 1. MIABPAD — DAO Launchpad (Phase 1)

The first product in the MIAB ecosystem — a **community-governed launchpad** where projects are reviewed, voted, and launched by holders.

- Fair and bonding-curve style launches
- Liquidity pairing and automated listing
- On-chain voting using MIAB governance power

💸 **Revenue Flow:**

Platform fees are used to **buy back MIAB** and strengthen liquidity, while a share of earnings goes into the **Builder Treasury** to fund future tools.

> **"The first platform that turns belief into buyback."**

---

### 📊 2. MIAB PORTFOLIO — Degen Tracker (Phase 2)

A multichain portfolio dashboard built with attitude — tracking everything from profits and losses to your most rugged trades.

- Unified wallet view across chains
- Custom insights and leaderboards
- Token usage data integrated for future vault rewards

💸 **Revenue Flow:**

Premium access is payable in MIAB. Usage revenue contributes to **buybacks** and supports the next wave of builders.

> **"Your on-chain chaos, beautifully organized."**

---

### ⚡ 3. BUYBOT — Multichain Trade Assistant

An automated trading tool that scans new launches, detects stealth deploys, and executes instant buys based on holder-set conditions.

- Cross-chain compatibility
- Custom alerts and filters
- Subscription tiers settled in MIAB

💸 **Revenue Flow:**

All usage fees cycle into the Builder Treasury, reinforcing the **make-it-back loop.**

> **"Let your trades work while you sleep."**

---

### 🔍 4. On-Chain Researcher — Market Intelligence Hub

A research platform that uncovers upcoming launches, trending wallets, and early project signals — helping builders and traders stay ahead.

- Tracks new deploys, whales, and token movements
- Generates discovery feeds for MIABPAD launches
- Subscription payable in MIAB

💸 **Revenue Flow:**

Data-access fees return to the treasury and fund ecosystem growth.

> **"It finds opportunity before it goes viral."**

---

### 🌐 Continuous Expansion

The MIAB ecosystem doesn't end with these products — it evolves continuously through **new tool development, partnerships, and acquisitions**.

The team's long-term focus is to:

- **Acquire and integrate** existing degen dApps under the MIAB token economy.
- **Develop new utilities** that expand MIAB's on-chain use cases.
- **Create partnerships** where external platforms accept MIAB for access or fees.

Each new addition increases token velocity and reinforces the **flywheel of value and creation.**

> **"We build. We acquire. We make it all back — together."**

---

## 🔁 The MIAB Flywheel

1. **Buyers** join through the bonding curve.
2. **Fees & decay** feed the **Builder Treasury**.
3. Treasury **funds AI tool development**.
4. Tools **charge MIAB** for access.
5. Demand **loops back** — strengthening token utility.

> **"Every fade funds the next build."**

---

## 💠 Tokenomics

| **Property** | **Value** |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Name** | Make It All Back |
| **Ticker** | MIAB |
| **Type** | ERC20 (BNB Chain) |
| **Supply** | 1,000,000,000 |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Debase Rate** | 0.00002% per block (~4.32% daily) |
| **Vaults** | Protector, Rebirth, Builder |

### 🧱 Game Theory

MIAB isn't just a market — it's a **belief engine**.

Every holder decays, but the ecosystem grows.

Every token lost fuels another line of code, another AI system, another step toward making it all back.

> **Supply dies, but creation lives.**

This cyclical mechanic creates **balance**: as token count shrinks, LP and vault balances shrink equally — keeping the price equilibrium intact while pushing demand higher through real utility.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Builder Treasury

All MIAB collected from:

- Curve fees
- Vault rebirth mint
- Tool payments

…flows into the **Builder Treasury**, which funds new AI teams, dev hires, and tool launches.

The treasury operates transparently, with proposals voted by MIAB holders.

> **"If you can build, you're welcome here."**

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental, community-driven protocol exploring belief, decay, and AI-driven creation.

It is not a financial product or investment.

Participation is voluntary and carries risk.

All interactions (bonding curve, vaults, or tools) are part of a conceptual experiment.

Revenue is used solely to expand the builder ecosystem and fund new AI development teams.
