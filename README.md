## 🌍 Overview

**MIAB (Make It All Back)** is an experimental memecoin that blends **degen culture, innovation, and deflationary mechanics** into one living system.

Built on **BNB Chain**, MIAB is more than a token — it’s a **community-funded builder engine**.

Each block decays its supply, but that decay fuels the next cycle of creation: funding new degen tools, hiring, and expanding the ecosystem.

---

## 🧠 The Cause

Everyone in crypto has said it once:

> “Don’t worry, I’ll make it all back.”

MIAB turns that meme into a mission — an **on-chain builder experiment** powered by belief, burn, and rebirth.

Every purchase through the bonding curve contributes to the **Builder Treasury**, used to develop products for the degen world — from **buy bots**, to **alpha scanners**, to **launchpads**, and more.

---

## 🚀 Launch Phases

### Phase 1 — The Spark
MIAB appears. The experiment is revealed to the BNB community — a call for believers who understand that real degens don’t just ape; they build.

### Phase 2 — The Genesis Curve
A **bonding curve** opens, allowing early believers to mint MIAB by sacrificing base assets.  
The curve uses the **Uniswap V2 formula (x × y = k)**, creating a self-contained market before open trading.  
Once the Genesis pool fills, liquidity is automatically paired and launched.  
That marks the **birth of MIAB** — and the beginning of the decay cycle.

### Phase 3 — The Debase Engine Activates
After liquidity forms, the **Debase Engine** awakens.  
From that block onward, the total MIAB supply begins to **decay by ~4% daily**, block by block.  
Supply vanishes — belief gets tested — but the ecosystem continues to evolve.

---

## 🧩 Bonding Curve Governance

Unlike typical bonding curves, MIAB’s curve is **governed by the community**.  
Selling during the Genesis phase is controlled through **on-chain voting**.

### 🗳️ Voting Logic
- **Eligibility:** Only wallets that have purchased MIAB on the bonding curve can vote.  
- **Power:** 1 vote per **1,000,000 MIAB** bought.  
- **Options:** *Enable* or *Disable* Selling.  
- **Vote Reset:** Selling any MIAB burns your vote.

> “If you dump, you lose your voice.”

## ⚙️ The Debase Engine

The **Debase Engine** is the mathematical heart of MIAB — a continuous entropy loop that shrinks supply at the block level.

- **Average block time:** 0.4s  
- **Debase rate:** **0.00002% per block** (~4.32% per day)

```txt
multiplier = multiplier * (1 - rate) ^ blocksElapsed
